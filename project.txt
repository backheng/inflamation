Project Outline
===============

Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time after surgery.
Jane is a Data Scientist and Samit is a statistician. 

We'll need to determine
who is responsible for what in this project.

We may need to bring a third person with Python programming skills into the project.
The third team member needs to be competent in both Python and R. They
also need to be familiar with matplotlib and ggplot.
Version control skills would also be useful.

We may also used gitlab and bitbucket.

We also can used Travis CL to do the automated testing for us.
